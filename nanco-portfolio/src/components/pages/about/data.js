        In July 2019 I have changed my career from Physics to IT and started my apprenticeship at Digitas Pixelpark GmbH.
        It was not an overnight decision. My bachelor thesis had a small programming part with Matlab. 
        It was a great experience for me, because more than coding I discovered that I love challenging errors and bugs! 
        The longer it takes to solve them, the more excited I am to solve it. Giving up is no option for me.

        In the last three years I have learned and tried dozens of languages and frameworks: Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Spring, Django, Vue, React, NodeJS, Express etc. to find the right one for me. Surprisingly I loved them all. They are all some kind of artworks to me, with different aspects and features.
